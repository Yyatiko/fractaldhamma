====== 37 Wings to Awakening ======

"So this is what you think of me: “The Blessed One, sympathetic, seeking our well-being, teaches the Dhamma out of sympathy.” Then you should train yourselves—harmoniously, cordially, and without dispute—in the qualities I have pointed out, having known them directly:

  - [[4_establishings_of_mindfulness|the four frames of reference]],
  - [[4_right_exertions|the four right exertions]],
  - [[4_bases_of_power|the four bases of power]],
  - [[5_faculties|the five faculties]],
  - [[5_strengths|the five strengths]],
  - [[7_factors_of_awakening|the seven factors for Awakening]],
  - [[8_fold_path|the noble eightfold path]]."
