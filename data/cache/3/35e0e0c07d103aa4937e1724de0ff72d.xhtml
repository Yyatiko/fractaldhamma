[Visakha, a layman, ex-husband of Ven. Sister Dhammadinna:] “And are the three aggregates [of virtue, concentration, discernment] included under the noble eightfold path, lady, or is the noble eightfold path included under the three aggregates?”
</p>

<p>
[Ven. Sister Dhammadinna:] “The three aggregates are not included under the noble eightfold path, friend Visakha, but the noble eightfold path is included under the three aggregates. <a href="/~lancelot/GitHub/fractaldhamma/doku.php?id=dhamma:right_speech" class="wikilink1" title="dhamma:right_speech" data-wiki-id="dhamma:right_speech">Right speech</a>, <a href="/~lancelot/GitHub/fractaldhamma/doku.php?id=dhamma:right_action" class="wikilink1" title="dhamma:right_action" data-wiki-id="dhamma:right_action">right action</a>, &amp; <a href="/~lancelot/GitHub/fractaldhamma/doku.php?id=dhamma:right_livelihood" class="wikilink1" title="dhamma:right_livelihood" data-wiki-id="dhamma:right_livelihood">right livelihood</a> come under the aggregate of virtue.

“Five blessings, householders, accrue to the righteous person through his practice of virtue: great increase of wealth through his diligence; a favorable reputation; a confident deportment, without timidity, in every society, be it that of nobles, brahmans, householders, or ascetics; a serene death; and, at the breaking up of the body after death, rebirth in a happy state, in a heavenly world.”

“And what is meant by admirable friendship? There is the case where a lay person, in whatever town or village he may dwell, spends time with householders or householders&#039; sons, young or old, who are advanced in virtue. He talks with them, engages them in discussions. He emulates consummate conviction [in the principle of kamma] in those who are consummate in conviction, consummate virtue in those who are consummate in virtue, consummate generosity in those who are consummate in generosity, and consummate discernment in those who are consummate in discernment. This is called admirable friendship.”

“Furthermore, there is the case where you recollect your own virtues: &#039;[They are] untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, conducive to concentration.&#039; At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting virtue, his mind is not overcome with passion, not overcome with aversion, not overcome with delusion. His mind heads straight, based on virtue. And when the mind is headed straight, the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal, gains a sense of the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. In one who is joyful, rapture arises. In one who is rapturous, the body grows calm. One whose body is calmed experiences ease. In one at ease, the mind becomes concentrated.”

“Monks, these four types of individuals are to be found existing in the world. Which four? The one who practices for his own benefit but not for that of others. The one who practices for the benefit of others but not for his own. The one who practices neither for his own benefit nor for that of others. The one who practices for his own benefit and for that of others.

“And how is one an individual who practices for his own benefit but not for that of others?

He himself abstains from sexual misconduct but doesn&#039;t encourage others in undertaking abstinence from sexual misconduct. He himself abstains from lying but doesn&#039;t encourage others in undertaking abstinence from lying.
