““The deep-grained attachment to the feeling of self does not arise for one who is endowed with these four conditions (pañña, wisdom; sacca, integrity; caga, generosity; and upasama, calm.). With no perception of self clouding one&#039;s consciousness one is said to be a muni, a peaceful one.” On what account did I say this? Perceptions such as &#039;I am,&#039; &#039;I am not,&#039; &#039;I will be,&#039; &#039;I will not be,&#039; &#039;I will have form,&#039; &#039;I will not have form,&#039; &#039;I will have no form,&#039; &#039;I will have perception,&#039; &#039;I will not have perception,&#039; &#039;I will neither have nor not have perception,&#039; monks, are an affliction, an ulcer, a dart. By transcending these perceptions one is a muni, a peaceful one.

“Monks, the muni is not born, does not age, does not die; he is not confused, nor does he yearn. There are no longer any causes for birth in him. Not being born, how can he age? Not aging, how can he die? Not dying, how can he be confused? Not being confused, how can he be desirous? “The deep-grained attachment to the feeling of self does not arise for one who is endowed with these four conditions. With no perception of self clouding one&#039;s consciousness, one is a muni, a peaceful one” – It was on this account that this statement was made.”

”&#039;He has been stilled where the currents of construing do not flow. And when the currents of construing do not flow, he is said to be a sage at peace.&#039; Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? &#039;I am&#039; is a construing. &#039;I am this&#039; is a construing. &#039;I shall be&#039; is a construing. &#039;I shall not be&#039;… &#039;I shall be possessed of form&#039;… &#039;I shall not be possessed of form&#039;… &#039;I shall be percipient&#039;… &#039;I shall not be percipient&#039;… &#039;I shall be neither percipient nor non-percipient&#039; is a construing. Construing is a disease, construing is a cancer, construing is an arrow. By going beyond all construing, he is said to be a sage at peace.

<p>
“Furthermore, a sage at peace is not born, does not age, does not die, is unagitated, and is free from longing. He has nothing whereby he would be born. Not being born, will he age? Not aging, will he die? Not dying, will he be agitated? Not being agitated, for what will he long? It was in reference to this that it was said, &#039;He has been stilled where the currents of construing do not flow. And when the currents of construing do not flow, he is said to be a sage at peace.&#039; Now, monk, you should remember this, my brief analysis of the six properties.”
