“And what is the stress of not getting what is wanted? In beings subject to birth, the wish arises, &#039;O, may we not be subject to birth, and may birth not come to us.&#039; But this is not to be achieved by wanting. This is the stress of not getting what is wanted. In beings subject to aging… illness… death… sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair, the wish arises, &#039;O, may we not be subject to aging… illness… death… sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair, and may aging… illness… death… sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair not come to us.&#039; But this is not to be achieved by wanting. This is the stress of not getting what is wanted.
