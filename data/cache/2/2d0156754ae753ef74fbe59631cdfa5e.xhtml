[Ven. Sariputta:] “Friends, just as the footprints of all legged animals are encompassed by the footprint of the elephant, and the elephant&#039;s footprint is reckoned the foremost among them in terms of size; in the same way, all skillful qualities are gathered under the four noble truths. Under which four? Under the noble truth of stress, under the noble truth of the origination of stress, under the noble truth of the cessation of stress, and under the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.”

[The Buddha speaks of his Awakening:]

<p>
“Vision arose, insight arose, discernment arose, knowledge arose, illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before: &#039;This is the noble truth of stress&#039;… &#039;This noble truth of stress is to be comprehended&#039;… &#039;This noble truth of stress has been comprehended&#039;…
</p>

<p>
“Vision arose, insight arose, discernment arose, knowledge arose, illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before: &#039;This is the noble truth of the origination of stress&#039;… &#039;This noble truth of the origination of stress is to be abandoned&#039;… &#039;This noble truth of the origination of stress has been abandoned.&#039;
</p>

<p>
“Vision arose, insight arose, discernment arose, knowledge arose, illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before: &#039;This is the noble truth of the cessation of stress&#039;… &#039;This noble truth of the cessation of stress is to be directly experienced&#039;… &#039;This noble truth of the cessation of stress has been directly experienced.&#039;
</p>

<p>
“Vision arose, insight arose, discernment arose, knowledge arose, illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before: &#039;This is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress&#039;… &#039;This noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress is to be developed&#039;… &#039;This noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress has been developed.&#039;

“And, monks, as long as this knowledge &amp; vision of mine — with its three rounds &amp; twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are present — was not pure, I did not claim to have directly awakened to the right self-awakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its devas, Maras, &amp; Brahmas, with its contemplatives &amp; brahmans, its royalty &amp; commonfolk. But as soon as this knowledge &amp; vision of mine — with its three rounds &amp; twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are present — was truly pure, then I did claim to have directly awakened to the right self-awakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its devas, Maras &amp; Brahmas, with its contemplatives &amp; brahmans, its royalty &amp; commonfolk. Knowledge &amp; vision arose in me: &#039;Unprovoked is my release. This is the last birth. There is now no further becoming.&#039;”
