“And what is right livelihood? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with right livelihood: This is called right livelihood.”

“Herein, Vyagghapajja, a householder knowing his income and expenses leads a balanced life, neither extravagant nor miserly, knowing that thus his income will stand in excess of his expenses, but not his expenses in excess of his income.
</p>

<p>
“Just as the goldsmith, or an apprentice of his, knows, on holding up a balance, that by so much it has dipped down, by so much it has tilted up; even so a householder, knowing his income and expenses leads a balanced life, neither extravagant nor miserly, knowing that thus his income will stand in excess of his expenses, but not his expenses in excess of his income.”

“And how is right view the forerunner? One discerns wrong livelihood as wrong livelihood, and right livelihood as right livelihood. And what is wrong livelihood? Scheming, persuading, hinting, belittling, &amp; pursuing gain with gain. This is wrong livelihood…
</p>

<p>
“One tries to abandon wrong livelihood &amp; to enter into right livelihood: This is one&#039;s right effort. One is mindful to abandon wrong livelihood &amp; to enter &amp; remain in right livelihood: This is one&#039;s right mindfulness. Thus these three qualities — right view, right effort, &amp; right mindfulness — run &amp; circle around right livelihood.”

Then Yodhajiva the headman went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: “Lord, I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of warriors that &#039;When a warrior strives &amp; exerts himself in battle, if others then strike him down &amp; slay him while he is striving &amp; exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle.&#039; What does the Blessed One have to say about that?”
</p>

<p>
“Enough, headman, put that aside. Don&#039;t ask me that.”
</p>

<p>
A second time… A third time Yodhajiva the headman said: “Lord, I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of warriors that &#039;When a warrior strives &amp; exerts himself in battle, if others then strike him down &amp; slay him while he is striving &amp; exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle.&#039; What does the Blessed One have to say about that?”
</p>

<p>
“Apparently, headman, I haven&#039;t been able to get past you by saying, &#039;Enough, headman, put that aside. Don&#039;t ask me that.&#039; So I will simply answer you. When a warrior strives &amp; exerts himself in battle, his mind is already seized, debased, &amp; misdirected by the thought: &#039;May these beings be struck down or slaughtered or annihilated or destroyed. May they not exist.&#039; If others then strike him down &amp; slay him while he is thus striving &amp; exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the hell called the realm of those slain in battle. But if he holds such a view as this: &#039;When a warrior strives &amp; exerts himself in battle, if others then strike him down &amp; slay him while he is striving &amp; exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle,&#039; that is his wrong view. Now, there are two destinations for a person with wrong view, I tell you: either hell or the animal womb.”
</p>

<p>
When this was said, Yodhajiva the headman sobbed &amp; burst into tears. [The Blessed One said:] “That is what I couldn&#039;t get past you by saying, &#039;Enough, headman, put that aside. Don&#039;t ask me that.&#039;”

“I&#039;m not crying, lord, because of what the Blessed One said to me, but simply because I have been deceived, cheated, &amp; fooled for a long time by that ancient teaching lineage of warriors who said: &#039;When a warrior strives &amp; exerts himself in battle, if others then strike him down &amp; slay him while he is striving &amp; exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle.&#039;

Then Talaputa, the head of an acting troupe, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: “Lord, I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of actors that &#039;When an actor on the stage, in the midst of a festival, makes people laugh &amp; gives them delight with his imitation of reality, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas.&#039; What does the Blessed One have to say about that?”

“Apparently, headman, I haven&#039;t been able to get past you by saying, &#039;Enough, headman, put that aside. Don&#039;t ask me that.&#039; So I will simply answer you. Any beings who are not devoid of passion to begin with, who are bound by the bond of passion, focus with even more passion on things inspiring passion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festival. Any beings who are not devoid of aversion to begin with, who are bound by the bond of aversion, focus with even more aversion on things inspiring aversion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festival. Any beings who are not devoid of delusion to begin with, who are bound by the bond of delusion, focus with even more delusion on things inspiring delusion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festival. Thus the actor — himself intoxicated &amp; heedless, having made others intoxicated &amp; heedless — with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in what is called the hell of laughter. But if he holds such a view as this: &#039;When an actor on the stage, in the midst of a festival, makes people laugh &amp; gives them delight with his imitation of reality, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas,&#039; that is his wrong view.
